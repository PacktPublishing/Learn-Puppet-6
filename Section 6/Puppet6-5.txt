-- Roles are simply collections of profiles that 
-- provide a sensible mapping between human logic 
-- technology logic. Roles may look something like:

class role { 
  include profile::base
}

class role::www inherits role { 
  # All WWW servers get tomcat
  include profile::tomcat
}

class role::www::dev inherits role::www { 
  include profile::webserver::dev
  include profile::database
}

class role::www::live inherits role::www { 
  include profile::webserver::live
}

class role::mailserver inherits role { 
  include profile::mailserver
}

class role { 
  include profile::base
}
 
class role::www inherits role { 
  # All WWW servers get tomcat
  include profile::tomcat
}
 
class role::www::dev inherits role::www { 
  include profile::webserver::dev
  include profile::database
}
 
class role::www::live inherits role::www { 
  include profile::webserver::live
}
 
class role::mailserver inherits role { 
  include profile::mailserver
}
