## About the Video Course
Puppet is a DevOps configuration management tool used to configure a large number of servers efficiently and prevent configuration drift. Puppet automates your IT configurations by taking control of the configuration settings for each server in your enterprise. This course gets you up-and-running with Puppet 6 and will take you from a complete beginner to a confident Puppet user.

You'll learn how to build a Puppet environment in the cloud, explore different Puppet distributions, and configure them. You'll work with different Puppet 6 modules, learn to configure a cloud-based Puppet master and Puppet agent, and utilize its advanced configuration options. You'll learn how to configure multiple Puppet environments, manage files with Puppet, refactor the configuration code for Puppet masters and Puppet agents, and use the right Puppet architectures with the right Puppet configuration. You'll use various resource types available in Puppet; write your own manifests; handle dependencies, implement simple and advanced configuration techniques, and explore how Puppet handles system resources.

By the end of this course, you will have gained the skills you need to manage your IT infrastructure effectively with Puppet and will be proficient with Puppet, spending less time writing and testing scripts.
